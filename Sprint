The Sprint
The sprint is the dedicated time boxed event where the solution Increment is built. The main sprint of the sprint is to deliver a working solution increment at the end of the sprint. The sprint is time boxed for days. A typical sprint is 10 business days. However, it could be longer, or shorter, than 10 business days as Scrum is a framework and is flexible. During the sprint, the team self organizes on the current user stories, tests, and other tasks to get the User Stories complete, or done.
